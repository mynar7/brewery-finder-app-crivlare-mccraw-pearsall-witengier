# brewery-finder-app-crivlare-mccraw-pearsall-witengier
This project is a collaboration between the members of Group 2 in Advanced Web Topics 2 (MMC6278). Our final project will utilize database technology, an authentication strategy, and server-side rendering to create a brewery finder application.

Once a user creates an account, they will have access to the brewery search feature using a zip code on the Search page. Once users preview breweries populated from their search, they will have the ability to save their favorite breweries directly from the Search page.  
The Favorites page is where users can review all of their selected favorite breweries in one locationâ€”they will also have the ability to remove breweries from their favorites list. 

Users will also have the ability to update their password and delete their accounts.

Group Challenges:
1. While we were able to complete a brewery search using the API, we could not connect the data to the favorites button and render to the Favorites page.
2. The error message if there are no breweries found for the Search page is not posting properly.
